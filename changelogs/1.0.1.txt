__**Version 1.0.1 - x April 2020**__

+ Added Info Command
+ Added Prefix Command
+ Added the ability to use the Bot's User Mention as its prefix (ie: "@CrimsonRoulette ping")

\* Moved Ping Command from "info" to "general" section of Help Command
\* Tweaked Command Cooldown messages to be in Minutes/Hours should the amount of seconds be long enough
\* Tweaked the likelyhood of my two joke features to be less common ;P
\* Changed the Roulette and Crimson Roulette Commands to use **tr** and **cr** command names respectively
\* Default CMD cooldown is now 3 seconds, TR's is 15 minutes, and CR's is 6 hours
\* Changed Setting CMD into Config CMD
\* Levelling Role Module now lists Roles (if any) in ascending Level Number order

\~ BUG FIX - Bot wouldn't give Tokens to Users when they type a message, but *would* when using Roulette Commands
